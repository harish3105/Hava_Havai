Important Instructions: 
Upon applying to the company, it is essential to participate in every stage of the interview process. 
If you don't participate in the interview process, companies lose trust in NxtWave, and they might not hire through NxtWave again. 
This makes it harder for students to get job opportunities if companies don't come back. So, it's really important to attend all the interview process rounds once you apply to a company.
Failure to attend any round will result in placing your profile on hold for the next two months.
